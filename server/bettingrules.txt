Must raise as much as previous bet 
 
i.e. 
 
player 1 bets 100 
 
player 2 has to raise at least 100. Lets say he raises to 300. 
 
player 3 now has to raise at least 200.

Because the raise was from 100, to 300, a 200 raise, while being a 300 bet. 
 
 
 
If all in is less than minimum bet: 
 
blinds are 100/200. 
 
Player 1 raises to 325. Less than minium raise of 200, to 400. 
 
Player 2 can raise to 525 or higher. Bet was less than minimum raise, so minimum raise is just the legal raise. 
 
 
 
Can player re-raise? 
 
blinds are 100/200. 
 
player 1 raises to 500, raise of 300.

player 2 goes all for 750, raise of 250, rather than minimum of 300.

player 3 calls 750.

Now, technically no-one has called player 1's raise, so he can only call or fold.

Note, player 3 could have raised if he liked.
Someone going all in doesn't magically remove the opportunity to raise.

You only can't raise, if your raise hasn't been called.
